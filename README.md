What's up! üëã 

My name is Nathan Tran and I am a Master's student at the University of Michigan studying Data Analytics graduating in May 2023. 
I just recently finished my Bachelor's also at Michigan in May 2022 with a degree in Information Analysis and a minor in Applied Statistics.
I have knowledge in Python, SQL, R, and Tableau. 
I'm passionate about sports specifically any of the Chicago sports teams and of course Michigan sports too (Go Blue! „ÄΩÔ∏è)! 
I'm a positive and responsible individual who is eager to use data to help others in any way I can!
